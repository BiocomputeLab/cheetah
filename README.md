# cheetah

Cheetah is a simple to use library to carry out training and analysis of microscopy images using an artifical deep neural network based on the U-Net architecture. It provides functions to augment test data and provide statistics as to the quality of the training process, as well as the ability to save and load trained networks for near real-time segmentation of key features in images (e.g. cell bodies and boundaries). Additional functions to provide cell numbering and tracking across images are also available.
